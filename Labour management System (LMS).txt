#How It Works

Worker Access:
Workers visit the website and fill out an application form.
The form data is submitted and stored in the database with a "pending" status.

Admin Access:
Admins log in to the admin panel using secure credentials.
Admins can view all pending applications, approve or reject them, and add comments.
Workers are notified of their application status (e.g., via email or on the website).
